                    <li>
                Siddhartha Gautama, most commonly referred to as the Buddha ('the awakened'), was a
             wandering ascetic and religious teacher who lived
              in South Asia during the 6th or 5th century BCE and founded Buddhism.
               According to Buddhist legends, he was born in Lumbini, in what is now Nepal, to royal parents
                of the Shakya clan, but renounced his home life to live as a wandering ascetic. After leading a life of
                 mendicancy, asceticism, and 
                meditation, he attained nirvana[i] at Bodh Gaya in what is now India. The Buddha then wandered through the lower
                 Indo-Gangetic Plain, teaching and building a monastic order. Hello
                 He died in Kushinagar, reaching <br>
             parinirvana, final extinction.</p> </li>
            <li> <p>According to the Buddhist tradition, the
                 Buddha taught a Middle Way between sensual
                  indulgence and severe asceticism,[8] leading
                   to freedom from ignorance, craving, rebirth, and suffering.
                    His core teachings are summarized in the Four Noble Truths and the Noble
                     Eightfold Path, a training of the mind that includes ethical training and kindness 
                     toward others, and meditative practices such as sense restraint, mindfulness, dhyana (meditation proper) and 
                     the concept of
                      dependent origination, emphasizing the impermanent and
                 interconnected nature of all things.</p></li>
             <li> <p>About two centuries after his death, he came to
                 be known by the title Buddha;[9] his teachings
                  were compiled by the Buddhist community in the 
                  Vinaya, his codes for monastic practice, and the Sutta Piá¹­aka, a
                   compilation of teachings based on his discourses. These were passed down in Middle Indo-Aryan 
                   dialects through an oral tradition.[10][11] Later generations composed
                    additional texts, such as systematic treatises known as Abhidharma, biographies 
                    of the Buddha, collections of stories about his past lives known as Jataka tales, and 
                    additional discourses, i.e., the 
                Mahayana sutras.</p> <br></li>
               <li> <p>Buddhism spread beyond the Indian
                     subcontinent, evolving into a variety of
                      traditions and practices. The Buddha is recognized
                       in other religious traditions, such as Hinduism, where
                        he is considered an avatar of Vishnu. His legacy is not only
                         encapsulated in religious institutions, but in the iconography
                          and art inspired by his life and teachings, ranging from aniconic
                           symbols to iconic depictions
                     in various cultural styles.</p></li>
